Rules:

- It is possible to change the values of the simulation, such as grid dimension, number of animals etc. through the Constants.py file.
- Press the space bar to generate the next state of the simulation. This will be stored in a list to be checked out later.
  If you want to check out the previous states, you can switch to navigation mode pressing "n" and go through them using
  the arrows: left for previous and right for next. BE CAREFUL, you can only switch back to initialization mode by
  pressing "i" if you are in the lastly created state. That is to prevent you from changing any of the states that had
  already been created.
